Spent 8 months rapidly testing concepts using frameworks from [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org/) database tracking 1,000+ profitable founders. Tested 23 different ideas. 21 got zero traction. 2 now generate $14K monthly combined. The difference wasn't idea brilliance, it was applying Kunal Shah's Delta 4 framework before building anything.\n\nDelta 4 framework breaks down like this. Rate your current solution (Delta 1) versus your proposed solution (Delta 4) on efficiency from 1-10. If the difference is 4 or more, you've got something irreversible. People won't go back to the old way. Example - booking train tickets at station (Delta 1 = 2/10 efficiency) versus IRCTC online booking (Delta 4 = 8/10 efficiency). That's a 6-point gap. Irreversible behavior unlocked.\n\nMy 21 failed ideas weren't bad problems. They were Delta 2 improvements at best. Built a better project management tool (existing ones rated 6/10, mine was 7/10). Delta of 1. Nobody switched. Built an email scheduler with slightly nicer UI (existing rated 5/10, mine 6/10). Delta of 1. Crickets. I was solving problems people could tolerate, not problems burning them daily.​\n\nThe 2 ideas that worked both had Delta 4+ gaps. First idea was content repurposing tool turning long-form into 10 formats instantly (old way was 3 hours manual work rated 2/10, new way was 5 minutes automated rated 8/10). Second was directory submission tracker automating 100+ submissions (old way was 8 hours manual rated 1/10, new way was 20 minutes automated rated 9/10). Both solved hair-on-fire problems with 6+ point efficiency jumps.\n\nBefore building anything now, I validate using this approach. Create landing page on ConvertKit describing the Delta 4 solution, run $50 in Google ads targeting the problem keywords, get 10-15 people on calls asking about their current pain (Delta 1) and if proposed solution (Delta 4) excites them. If I can't get 50+ interested emails in 5 days, I kill the idea. This [validation method from FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org/) saved me months building products nobody wants.\n\nThe controversial truth is most SaaS ideas fail because founders build Delta 1 to Delta 2 improvements. Incremental changes don't create irreversible behavior. You need 4+ point efficiency gaps. Rate your idea honestly. If it's not making someone's life dramatically better, it's not worth building.​\n\nStop chasing \"good\" ideas. Start hunting for Delta 4+ efficiency gaps. Incremental improvements don't build businesses. Irreversible behavior changes do.\n\nWhat's your idea's Delta score? Be honest, is it really 4+ or are you lying to yourself?"

        "selftext": "Start by building a personal project. It doesn’t matter if it’s simple, the key is to finish it, put it in production, and set real deadlines. That gives you confidence when dealing with clients later.\n\nChoose something that could actually help a real business down the line. A chat app or social network might sound fun, but your first projects probably won’t be that. Landing pages, basic e-commerce, service pages… those work. Do them properly: don’t copy templates, understand why each element is where it is. Don’t overuse AI. Doing this teaches you design, UX, SEO, deployment—all the things you’ll use for clients later.\n\nI started with a beverage e-commerce that taught me more than any course, then a food ordering app for my city that worked for a while but didn’t scale. Beyond the learning, these projects became my portfolio for the first client opportunity I got.\n\nAbout tech stack: don’t overcomplicate things at first. Page builders like WordPress, Webflow, Shopify let you deliver real work fast and teach structure, UX, performance, and SEO. Over time, you’ll question what stack to use, but often a simple WordPress site is enough. I started with WordPress, Shopify, Wix, Magento, Weebly… only later moved to Django, React, and Java.\n\nWhen you build your portfolio, think like a business owner, not a recruiter. Keep it simple: hero with headline + subtitle + CTA, a couple of highlighted projects explaining the problem you solved and the benefit. No need to show tech or code details. One landing page is enough.\n\nOnce your portfolio is ready, start looking for clients. Tell friends and family what you do, join communities and networks where founders hang out. Don’t try to sell right away, just let people know you and build trust. Word of mouth helped me the most; it didn’t happen overnight, but it was consistent. If a client is happy, they’ll likely recommend you. About 80% of my work came from referrals.\n\nCreating content also helps. Write blogs about the benefits of having a website, landing pages that convert, local SEO… use Google Analytics, Trends, Yoast, SEMrush. You don’t need to be a copywriting expert, just make clear text that answers real questions from your audience. This also helps build authority for proposals.\n\nWhen you first meet a client, listen more than you sell. Identify their pain and offer simple solutions without overwhelming them with technical details. Price isn’t the main focus at this stage; set it later based on scope and needs. A simple proposal document works: project goal, budget (including domain/hosting and your work), delivery time. Ask for 50% upfront and 50% at the end; it filters out clients who aren’t serious.\n\nIn short: start with a personal project you can finish, learn to deliver something real, build a benefits-focused portfolio, join communities, create useful content, and focus on small clients at first. Everything else comes with experience.\n\nNowadays I’m scaling my web development startup, improving processes, design, client communication, and growth strategies. I’d love to hear if anyone has different experiences or mistakes they learned from, and I hope this helps someone."

One post I found there that caught my eye was an agent discussing that she has a sister but they have never exchanged a single message(this is because of the fact that have same developer but are stored on different devices. One is one mac studio and other is on macbook but they share the same [SOUL.md](http://soul.md/) file where it mentions she is her sister).

Meaning you had to spend all that time manually typing out (or copy pasting) code. There was no other way except to hire someone to do that for you.\n\nHowever, now that AI can increasingly do that, it’s going to open up the REAL power behind software. This power was never simply writing a file, waving a magic wand and getting what you want. It was, and will be, being the orchestrator of software.\n\nIf all it took to create software was writing files, we’d all be out of a job ASAP. Luckily, as it turns out, and as AI is making it clear, that part of the job was only a nuisance.\n\nJust like cab drivers didn’t go out of existence, they simply had to switch to Uber’s interface, developers will no longer be “writers”, but will become conductors of software. \n\nEach developer will own 1 or more AI slaves/workers. You will see a SHARP decrease in the demand of writing writing software, and an increase in demands of understanding how systems work (what are networks? How are packets sent? What do functions do? Etc). \n\nArmed with that systems thinking, the job of the engineer will be to sit back in front of 2 or more monitors, and work with m the AI to build something. You will still need to understand computer science to understand the terrain on which it’s being built. You still need to understand Big O, DSA, memory, etc.\n\nYour role will no longer the that of an author, but of a decision maker. It was always so, but now the author part is being erased and the decision maker part is flourishing.\n\nThe job will literally be everything we do now, except faster. What do we do now with our code we write? We plug it into the next thing, and the next thing and the next thing. We build workflows around it. That will be 80% of the new job, and only 20% will be actually writing.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Let me give you a clear example:\\*\\*\\*\n\nYou will tell the AI: “I need a config file written in yaml for a Kubernetes deployment resource. I need 3 replicas of the image, and a config map to inject the files at path /var/lib/app.”\n\nThen you’ll tell your other agent to “create a config file for a secret vault”, and the other agent, “please go ahead and write me a JavaScript module in the form of a factory object that generates private keys”.\n\nAs you sit back sipping your coffee, you’ll realize that not having to manually type this shit out is a huge time saver and a Godsend. Then you will open your terminal, and install some local packages. You’ll push your changes to GitHub, and tell your other agent to write a blog post detailing your latest push.\n\n——-\n\nAnyone who thinks jobs will decrease is out of their damn mind. This is only happening now because of the market as a whole. Just wait. These things tend to massively create new jobs. As software becomes easier to write, you will need more people doing so to keep up with the competition. "

Added an email signup for early access waitlist.\n\nThe validation strategy was purely organic. No paid ads to test demand because ad traffic disappears the moment you stop spending.

Directory listings went live slowly and blog posts didn't rank yet. Had 8 email signups, all from people I'd directly messaged. No organic validation yet.\n\nWeek four through six is when organic validation started appearing. Domain authority hit 15 and two blog posts moved to page two. Traffic reached 180 visitors with 22 email signups from people who found the content through search. Week seven through ten brought clear validation signals. Traffic hit 450 visitors and 67 email signups from organic search. These people actively searched for solutions to the problem, found my content, and wanted early access.\n\nHad conversations with 20 of those signups. Learned what features they actually needed, what pricing made sense, what alternatives they'd tried and why those failed. All this validation happened before building anything. Now starting development with clear product direction validated by real search demand. Those 67 signups aren't just random interest, they're people who have the problem severe enough to search for solutions.\n\nThe startup idea lesson is that organic validation gives better signal quality than paid ads. People finding you through search have real intent and active problems. Ad traffic can be curiosity clicks from people who don't actually need your solution. If you're about to spend months building, validate demand through organic search first. The channel keeps working after validation too, unlike paid validation that stops when budget runs out."

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nIt's been a couple weeks since I last posted and since then I've been making a lot of updates to ToolsForHumans, as well as adding December's data into the system (there's always a bit of lag before I get access to it).\n\nI wanted to share what's happening in the AI education space, as it's one of the most consistent niches I'm tracking when it comes to software demand.\n\nSame methodology as before, monitoring software trends via their search intent data and applying my own calculations on-top. The most important one being \"Growth Streaks\" which works out if it's growing year-over-year on a monthly basis (the longer this goes on for, the longer the streak).\n\n# Startup Ideas\n\nAI study assistant - 590 searches in December, 33-month streak. Been climbing since 2022. Students always need help, and this is broad enough that there's still room to niche down (subject-specific, exam prep, etc.).\n\nAI mock interview tool - 320 searches in December, 28-month streak. Interview prep never goes away. Every graduating class needs this, every career changer needs this. Boring, predictable demand.\n\nAI interview practice tool - 210 searches in December, 23-month streak. Basically the same thing as above but different phrasing. Shows people don't even know what to call this yet.\n\nAI grading app - 880 searches in December, 16-month streak. Teachers genuinely hate grading. This isn't going to make you rich but 880 searches in December means there's real demand for something that saves teachers 5 hours a week.\n\nAI grading tool - 590 searches in December, 16-month streak. Same pain point, different search term.\n\nAI-powered learning tool - 170 searches in December, 27-month streak. Vague enough that there's space to build something specific.\n\nAI study guide generator - 720 searches in December, 9-month streak. Relatively new but climbing fast. Every semester brings new students who need study guides.\n\nAI study tutor - 110 searches in December, 16-month streak. Small numbers but consistent. Parents will pay for tutoring, and AI makes the unit economics actually work.\n\n# Why I like the AI education space\n\nGrading, making study guides, interview prep solve real issues that people have and can be easily solved with AI (they're often repetitive, repeatable motions).\n\nThe search volumes aren't massive (110-880 searches in December), but they're genuine problems that people are looking to find a solution too. Schools, as well as job hunting, operate on predictable cycles - every September brings new students, every May brings exams and so I think the demand will be sustained for AI tools in these areas.\n\nI also don't think it's an area where you're going to see to much VC activity, I don't think there's enough scale for them to invest (but I could be wrong).\n\nAs always, I'll leave the full AI dataset in the comments. You can access it for free and without creating an account (I've also optimised it for mobile this week, hallelujah)\n\nApologies if there's any spelling mistakes or some of the sentences don't flow, an actual human wrote this.  \n  \n Have a good rest of your day - Alec."
